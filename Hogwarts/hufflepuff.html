        <h1>Hufflepuff</h1>
        <p> Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
            <br>Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. 
            <br>Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.</p>

            <h3>Common Room</h3>
            <p>The Hufflepuff dormitories and common room were never been seen by outsiders and was the only house with repelling devices in case of intruders. </p>
                <p>They were accessed through a pile of large barrels, found stacked in a shadowy stone recess on a right-hand side corridor near the kitchens. The barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row, would open if tapped in the rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff".</p>

            <h3>Reputation</h3>
            <p> According to Minerva McGonagall, all four of the houses produced exceptional witches and wizards in their time, 
                but due to Helga Hufflepuff's policy of accepting any student Hufflepuff is often thought to be the house of less talented wizards and witches. </p>
                <p>However, this was merely a misunderstanding of the <br>Sorting Hat's poem.</p>

                While the other founders chose to have special students, she accepted them all without preference, 
                but the students of her house are described as loyal and hard-working.</p>
