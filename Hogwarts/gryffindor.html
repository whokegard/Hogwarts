        <h1>Gryffindor</h1>
        <p> Gryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric Gryffindor. <br>Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination, to be sorted into his house.</p>

            <h3>Traits</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Courage</li>
            <li>Bravery</li>
            <li>Determination</li>

        <div class="houses-col" id="gryffindor">
            <h3>Common Room</h3>
            <p> The entrance to the Gryffindor common room (which, in turn, lead to the Gryffindor dormitories) is located behind a large painting of a Fat Lady in a pink silk dress. 
                <br>If you know the right password to tell her, she swings open to reveal a round opening in the wall. The common room contains a lot of squashy armchairs, a fireplace, and tables. The fireplace is connected to the Floo Network, but as it is extremely public except in the dead of night, Gryffindors usually use owls to communicate with their families instead.</p>

        <div class="houses-col" id="gryffindor">
            <h3>Reputation</h3>
            <p> Gryffindors and Slytherins had shared a fierce house rivalry since their founders, Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin, respectively, had a severe falling out over Slytherin's emphasis on blood purity. 
                There might also be an element of feeling wronged, as Harry and his fellow Gryffindors tended to win in a lot of circumstances which, when viewed from a neutral point of view, may be considered unfair.</p>
