        <h1>Slytherin</h1>
        <p> Slytherin was one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar Slytherin. 
            <br>In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued. 
            <br>Those characteristics included cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition.</p>

            <h3>Traits</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Resourcefulness</li>
            <li>Determination</li>
            <li>Pride</li>
            <li>Cunning</li>
            <li>Ambition</li>

            <h3>Common Room</h3>
            <p>The Slytherin common room was in the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle and underneath the Black Lake. Because of this, the light in the common room was green. 
                <br>To enter the Slytherin common room one must merely speak aloud the current password in front of a stretch of a damp stone wall; once the word was uttered a concealed stone door would slide aside leaving a rectangular hole in the wall leading to the Slytherin common room. The only known Slytherin password was "pureblood", used in 1992.</p>

        <div class="houses-col" id="slytherin">
            <h3>Reputation</h3>
            <p> Slytherin had a well-known reputation for creating Dark Witches and Wizards that many would even say that every Dark Witch or Wizard was actually in Slytherin (it also didn't help that Voldemort himself was in Slytherin too when he was a student at Hogwarts). 
                <br>While it was true that many were in the house, it was untrue to say every single one of them was, as Peter Pettigrew, betrayer of James and Lily, was in Gryffindor and Quirinus Quirrell was in Ravenclaw.</p>
