        <h1>Ravenclaw</h1>
        <p> Ravenclaw was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
            <br>Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house were characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. 
            <br>The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze were its colours. 
            <br>The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.</p>

            <h3>Common Room</h3>
            <p>The Ravenclaw common room was in one of the castle's towers and was wide and circular. One had to climb a tight spiral staircase to get there. It had graceful arched windows, and the walls were hung with blue and bronze silks. 
                <br>The domed ceiling was painted with the night sky, which was echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. Tables, chairs, and bookcases covered the expanse of the floor, and a white marble statue of Rowena Ravenclaw sat next to the door that led to the dormitories above.</p>

            <h3>Reputation</h3>
            <p> According to Slytherin prefect Gemma Farley, Ravenclaws were so competitive when it came to academic success that they were known to backstab each other, and likely other students, in order to get top marks. 
                <br>While Hufflepuff prefect Gabriel Truman noted that they were so proud of the success of famous members, such as Laverne de Montmorency, that they claimed any intelligent wizard as a member of Ravenclaw House, such as Bridget Wenlock, who was, in fact, a Hufflepuff.</p>
